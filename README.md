## Solana frontend started kit

This template has everything you need to build a web3 app on Solana using the web3sdks SDK.

## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx web3sdks create --template next-typescript-solana-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `Web3sdksProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our hooks to work.

on `pages/index.tsx`, you'll find an example of a connect wallet button and some hooks.
